First of all, thanks for dropping by! here is my dotfiles repo, configurations that i'm making (rices)

In this repo, I'm sharing with you my rices, and offering you tips/instructions on how this things works
(but in fact, i don't really know how this works, cuz i don't know what I'm doing :/ so good luck :3 lmao).
