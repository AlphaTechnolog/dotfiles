### Enjoy ‚ù§Ô∏è

That's all! Now enjoy with this configuration!

## ‚Äé <samp>Tips üòé</samp>

### Multi theming support

I'm working in multi theming support for the config using a tool that I'm writing from scratch, [this is](../bin/themer).

The tool reads files from `~/.config/themes/templates` and recreate all the necessary files to apply the changes, in this config
i included two templates: dark-decay and night theme by [rxyhn](https://github.com/rxyhn).

You can change the theme using `themer -s <themename>` or `themer --switch <themename>`, more info could be obtained using:

```sh
themer --help
themer -h
```

so, you can write your own themes too using the templates in `~/.config/themes/templates` and then calling it using `themer`.

#### Demonstration

![themer-demonstration](./assets/themer.png)

### Neovim

If you want to open neovim without padding in st terminal, you can use `nv` instead of `neovim` (because in [bin](../bin) i put the `nv` script)

### Some keyboards shortcuts

| **shortcut** | **meaning** |
|--------------|-------------|
|super + shift + return|Open rofi|
|super + m|Toggle bar state (if show or not)|
|super + b|Spawn firefox|
|super + x|Spawn a screen color picker|
|super + alt + {h,j,k,l}|Resize the window|
|super + ctrl + {h,j,k,l}|Move a floating window|
|super + escape|Restart sxhkd|
|super + shift + q|Quit bspwm|
|super + shift + r|Restart bspwm|
|super + w|Close window|
|super + Tab|Alternate between monocle and tiled layout|
|super + space|Switch to floating layout|
|super + t|Switch to tiled layout|
|super + f|Switch to fullscreen layout|

> In the most of the cases, exists mouse based keybindings (but i really prefer use the shortcuts lol)
