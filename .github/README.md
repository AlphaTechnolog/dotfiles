**WARNING**: Configuration files present in the next paths might be overrided.

#### Create folders

First create folders if they aren't still there.

```sh
test -d ~/.config || mkdir -p ~/.config
test -d ~/.local/bin || mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
```

#### Copy dotfiles

Then, just copy the config files to the appropiate folders.

```sh
cp -r ./cfg/* ~/.config
cp -r ./bin/* ~/.local/bin
cp -r ./home/.Xresources ~
```

### Make powermenu buttons work.

Maybe the powermenu buttons don't work (just the poweroff and reboot ones), that's because i'm using doas combined
with some configuration to make `poweroff` and `reboot` commands work without password (and because i like doas more than sudo).

So, you have to setup doas to make that buttons work. See the next steps:


#### Install doas

You can install doas in any operative system, just check your operative system documentation, i'll asume you're using void linux,
but this can be done using any operative system.

Install doas using the `opendoas` package (assuming that you're using Void Linux):

```sh
sudo xbps-install opendoas -y
```

Then just configure it a bit, edit the file using your preferred cli editor with root privileges, i'll use vim.

```sh
sudo vim /etc/doas.conf
```

> You can use nano, code, etc.

Put the next in that file:

```
permit persist :wheel
permit nopass root
permit nopass :wheel cmd poweroff
permit nopass :wheel cmd reboot
```

Then, if you aren't in the wheel group, include yourself there.

```sh
sudo usermod -aG wheel $(whoami)
```

That should be enough. Basically the `doas.conf` that we copied-pasted in `/etc/doas.conf`, do the next:

- allow users in the `wheel` group to elevate privileges.
- allow root user to elevate privileges with no-password (because root already has root privileges)
- allow users in the `wheel` group to execute the command `poweroff` without password.
- allow users in the `wheel` group to execute the command `reboot` without password.

If you want, you can test doas in your terminal.

```sh
doas echo hello
```

> That command should ask you for password.

```sh
doas poweroff
```

> That command shouldn't ask you for password, it just should turn off the pc.

```sh
doas reboot
```

> That command shouldn't ask you for password, it just should reboot the pc.

## ‚Äé <samp>Tips üòé</samp>

### Wallpaper

If you just want the wallpaper (lol), see [this file](../cfg/awesome/assets/wallpaper.jpg)

### Changing Profile Photo

If you want to change your profile photo in the powermenu,
replace [this file](../cfg/awesome/assets/pfp.png) with
your profile photo (use png or change the path in [theme.lua](../cfg/awesome/theme.lua))

### Some keyboards shortcuts

| **shortcut** | **meaning** |
|--------------|-------------|
|super + shift + return|Open rofi|
|super + m|Maximize window|
|super + {j,k}|Move Window Focus|
|super + {h,l}|Resize the window|
|super + shift + q|Quit AwesomeWM|
|super + ctrl + r|Restart AwesomeWM|
|super + w|Close window|
|super + Tab|Switch layouts|

> In the most of the cases, exists mouse based keybindings (but i really prefer the shortcuts lol)

### Bling

You can use the official bling module, but I made some modifications in the source code
of bling to add multimonitor support in some parts, it's recommended to use my own version (for this dotfiles at least),
but anyway you can use another version or modification of the bling module if you want

> The same applies to all the modules inside the `modules` folder
